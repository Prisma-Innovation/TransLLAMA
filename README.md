# TransLLAMA

**TransLLAMA** is a research project developed by PRISMA S.R.L. that leverages local large language models to provide precise, context-aware translations. The entire codebase was generated solely by the ChatGPT o3-mini-high model, with human experts contributing only by defining the prompts. No manual code modifications were made.

## Overview

TransLLAMA demonstrates that it is possible to develop a complete web application entirely guided by a large language model. By leveraging advanced prompt engineering, our AI generated the entire codebase autonomously, showcasing the potential of AI-driven development in creating robust and user-friendly applications.

## Features

- **Automated Code Generation:** The entire project was generated by the ChatGPT o3-mini-high model; human intervention was limited only to prompt definitions.
- **Modern UI/UX:** Built using Next.js, Tailwind CSS, and lucide-react icons for a sleek and intuitive interface.
- **Internationalization:** Supports multiple languages through a backend-managed internationalization system.
- **Seamless Integration:** Utilizes the Ollama API to run local large language models.
- **Open Source:** The entire project is released under the MIT License and is available on GitHub.

## Requirements

- **Ollama:** You must download and install [Ollama](https://ollama.com) on your machine.
- **Local LLM Model:** For optimal performance, use a local large language model. For our tests, we recommend using `deepseek-r1:8b`.
